# EnzyHTP
Molecular simulations, such as quantum mechanics (QM), molecular mechanics (MM), and QM/MM modeling, have been widely applied to guide the design and discovery of new biocatalysts. They inform the time-resolved, atomic (even electronic) detail of enzymatic reactions, which complements the sequence and structure-level information obtained in experiments. As such, augmenting molecular simulation data holds great promise to improve the predictive power of machine learning models to evaluate mutation effects for enzyme catalysis. However, large-scale collection of molecular simulation data presents a big challenge. Multiple hierarchies of structural treatments are necessary for building a simulation-ready enzyme model, including determining protein stoichiometry, identifying the binding site, predicting amino acid protonation state, adding missing residues, performing an amino acid substitution, creating reacting species, and so on. In most enzyme modeling practices, these structural operations rely on manual curation, which is highly inefficient and hampers reproducibility.

Here we are developing a high-throughput enzyme simulation tool, EnzyHTP, that automates molecular model construction, mutation, sampling, and energy calculation (Figure 6). EnzyHTP consists of four modules. First, Protein Preparation module takes in the protein structure coordinate from PDB or IntEnzyDB, determines the protonation state of amino acids using PDB2PQR, and remedies missing residues and loops using Modeller. For substrate-enzyme complex files, the module will add hydrogen atoms for the substrate using OpenBabel. 
Second, Mutation Operation module generates enzyme mutations. Given a protein structure, the module will perform amino acid substitution either randomly or in a user-defined fashion. The resulting structures will be optimized using molecular mechanics in AMBER and then sent back to the Protein Preparation module to re-evaluate the protonation states for residues nearby the mutated amino acid. 
Third, Conformation Sampling module takes in the molecular models from the Protein Preparation/Operation module and sample conformational ensemble using molecular dynamics engine (i.e., AMBER) or Monte Carlo engine (i.e., Rosetta). With a given molecular model, the module builds the input files for the simulation, conducts conformational sampling, and assesses the root-mean-square fluctuation and configurational entropy for each residue based on the sampled conformers. These are amino acid-level features generated from atomistic modeling that informs the protein flexibility. 
Fourth, Energy Calculation module. The module will take the sample complex structure, prepare the input files for quantum mechanics (QM) or quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QMMM) computations, and execute the calculations using corresponding energy calculation engines (i.e., Gaussian, Terachem, etc.), and finally extract the energy or electronic structure properties.
